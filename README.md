New Neighbourhoods is a music festival taking part in Reykjavik, Iceland and Warsaw, Poland. 
The event needed a simple one-page website with line-up, presenation of artists and practical information.

I built a static website in order to save some time for animation fun.

The site is live here: [CLICK](http://newneighborhoodsfestival.com/).
